# AgileAirLineManager
# Project
Welcome to AgileAirlineManager! Our project is dedicated to developing an Agile Airline Manager, a comprehensive system designed to streamline airline management operations through the implementation of a microservices architecture with an event-driven approach.

# Key Features:
Microservices Architecture: Utilizing Java Spring Boot and Spring Cloud, our system is built upon a microservices architecture, enabling modular development and scalability.

Event-Driven Design: We leverage event-driven architecture to ensure seamless communication between microservices, allowing for real-time updates and efficient data processing.

Eureka Server: Employing Eureka Server as a service registry, we enable dynamic service discovery and load balancing within the microservices ecosystem.

API Gateway: Our system incorporates an API Gateway to provide a single entry point for client applications, facilitating routing, security, and other cross-cutting concerns.

# Technologies Used:
Java
Spring Boot
Spring Cloud
Eureka Server
API Gateway
